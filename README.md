## ***Plot***
In 2067, humanity faces extinction due to a global blight. Joseph Cooper, a widowed NASA pilot, raises his children Murph and Tom. Cooper deciphers a gravitational anomaly and finds a NASA base. Earth's crops fail, and a decade ago, the Lazarus team discovered habitable planets.

Cooper joins the Endurance team, a group of scientists, to explore a supermassive black hole called Gargantua. They survey a planet with double Earth's gravity, but are swept away by a wave. Cooper and Brand return to the Endurance, but lose 23 Earth-years due to time dilation. They discover Miller's death and the ship's false positive signals. Cooper watches his family grow up, get married, and loses his first son.

In 2092, Murph helps Professor Brand solve a gravity equation for humanity's future. However, Brand reveals the equation is unsolvable without information from a black hole's singularity. The only hope is to transport frozen embryos to a new planet. Cooper and TARS travel to a candidate planet, where Mann reveals Brand's plan to forsake humanity and populate a new colony using frozen embryos. Mann attacks the team, and Cooper and TARS sacrifice themselves to lighten the Endurance. Cooper discovers a four-dimensional tesseract in the black hole, allowing him to communicate with the past. The tesseract collapses, and Cooper and TARS are rescued by an O'Neill cylinder colony in 2156. Murph tells Cooper to seek out Amelia instead.
